Momentum Cloud Weather Test
---- Test requirements ----
These are the things we'd like to see when reviewing your code
The p.replace-me tag in this document has been replaced with a AngularJS Component
Weather data loads directly from the OpenWeatherMap API on page load for a given city
Dependency injection everywhere possible
API calls are encapsulated in AngularJS Services
Page has been styled and elements use Bootstrap classes
Style overrides are done using SASS (use the provided inline SASS compiler setup to make it easier)
Tests are provided for your component (any test is better than no test)
Add any libraries you'd like, and have fun! â˜º
e.g. The weather forecast for Sydney is Sunny

---- Approach ----

Languages/ Frameworks: Angular, Node.js, Express.js

To do: Add testing for Angular Components
